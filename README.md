# Color-Extractor

This is a simple color identification script which I created in order to extract RGB value of a specific color in an image. It can be very handy if you are facing difficulty in identifying a color in a development project.

To run this script type the following command in the command line:

                                            python color_detection.py -i "PATH OF YOUR IMAGE"
